### Graph Machine Learning

This course provides an introduction to machine learning on graphs. 

Many important real-world datasets can be represented as a graph of relationships between objects. Such networks are a basic tool for modeling social networks, knowledge graphs, the Web, and biological systems such as protein-interaction networks. Until recently, very little attention has been devoted to the generalization of neural network models to such structured datasets.

This course focuses on the computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges specific to the analysis of  graphs. By studying the underlying graph structure and its features, students are introduced to machine learning techniques and data mining tools better able to reveal insights on a variety of networks.

Topics include: representation learning and Graph Neural Networks; algorithms for the World Wide Web; reasoning over Knowledge Graphs; influence maximization; disease outbreak detection, social network analysis.

Lectures are augmented with hands-on tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks. Laboratory assignments will be completed using Python and related packages: PyTorch, PyG, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, StatsModels, SciKit-Learn, NetworkX, and MatPlotLib.
